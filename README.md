# Using the conda package management for Research Software Engineering

The distribution of research software is challenging due to
the complexity of dependencies and the speed of technological advancement.
Automation and standardization of this process speeds up the
development process, as well as the communication and interaction with the
users. This is particularly important for research software, as the number
of developers are limited and labor for infrastructural maintenance is
usually not available. In this workshop we want to discuss how the package
manager anaconda (https://conda.io) can be used to automate such a process.
The package manager works for various different programming languages, and
operating systems, and provides with the
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) channel a community-based platform to
distribute and build your own packages.

## Aim of this repository

This repository serves as a discussion forum for a workshop at the
[deRSE20](de-rse.org/deRSE20/) conference from 25th to 27th of August, 2020 in
Jena, Germany. However, this repository might also be an outcome itself as
described in [#1](https://github.com/Chilipp/conda-ci-workshop/issues/1).
